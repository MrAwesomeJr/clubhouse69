# clubhouse69

some random thing







edit 24/09/2023: this project was intended to be a sort of "games launcher". The idea was to have open-source peer-to-peer online multiplayer games, which would allow for people to play together (out of spite towards Clubhouse 51 being ridiculously expensive), as well as be a platform for people to submit game ideas with little approval process and be able to test and play it without having to deal with the netcode themselves (very streamlined!)

As it turns out this is completely delusional, considering I started this project without knowing anything about C++ or OpenGL. Writing functional code is hard. Writing functional C++ code is even harder.

Maybe I'll come back to this project later on in my life, but for now, I need to go figure out what I'm actually doing before I can do something as complex as this. Some things like halite and the p2p connections featured in my lamp_net repo are good starting points but this isn't being finished anytime soon. Sorry to disappoint you, but honestly I'm probably more disappointed in myself than you are in me, considering you likely didn't even know what this was before you clicked on it.

Until next github commit.
